Talk outline:

About me:

	Animator
		Maya, 3DS Max
	Designer
		Creative Suite, Traditional
	Developer
		AS3/Flash
		JS/CoffeeScript
		C#/.NET/MVC

	How I went from artist to dev.

	How does learning animation map to learning development? And if it maps one way, why can't it map to the other?
		Shader networks
		Hierarchies of objects
		Skeleton systems/Inverse kinematics

		Problem area? - Spline editors/ artists tools, because code may be too "bare metal".

	Illusion of Life
		Animation Principles
		    *Squash and stretch
		    	Perhaps this is a stylistic choice.
		    	Can you make a "serious looking" s'n's
		    *&Anticipation
		    *Staging
		    Straight ahead action and pose to pose
		    *Follow through and overlapping action
		    ***Slow in and slow out
		    *Arcs
		    *Secondary action
		    ***Timing
		    ??Exaggeration
		    	Stylistic? Maybe not. Prove me wrong.
		    Solid drawing
		    	Ahahahahahahaha
		    Appeal
